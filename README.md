# ShittySpritePainter...?
First program in C# with Visual Studio, basically a buggy sprite editor.
* A reminder that this program will **NOT** be updated since there are a lot of code smells that prevents anyone from properly debugging.
  * However this is a wakeup call for me to acquire good coding practices
### Uhh?
* This program was created out of interest to use with Unity.
* Due to complexity of implementing graphics related instances in Windows Form, this is extremely buggy.
### Features
* Bugs
* Sliders for choosing colours
* Ease of creating shades of chosen colours
* Saving and loading palettes from text files
* I believe there are 5 palettes and 5 colours per palettes.
* Custom dimensions
* Product is savable as png
### Anti-features
* Does not support alpha channels
* Good luck when you try to draw out-of-bounds(ERROR!)
